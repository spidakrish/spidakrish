## 👋 Hi, I'm Krish

**CEO & Co-founder @ [BackPro AI](https://backpro.ai)** - Building compliance-native AI solutions for regulated financial institutions in Australia.

### 🎯 What I'm Working On

I'm solving a critical problem: 133,000+ Australian financial services businesses can't legally use public AI tools like ChatGPT due to ASIC and APRA data sovereignty requirements. BackPro AI provides on-premises AI deployment that keeps data local and compliant.

**Recent Milestone**: Graduated from Genesis Accelerator (won best financial model award) and currently closing our first enterprise deals.

### 💡 Technical Background

- **Interests**: Quantitative finance, physics, and low-level systems
- **Currently Learning**: Verilog and Assembly 
- **Fun Fact**: I've done a cliff jump of 105 feet without a parachute

### 🤝 Open to Collaboration

I'm actively looking to collaborate on projects spanning finance, AI, and systems programming. If you're working on something interesting in these spaces, let's connect.
